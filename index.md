## About me
I'm a PhD student in Data Science and Criminology based in the [Leeds Institute for Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/) (University of Leeds). 

My project involves exploring police spatiotemporal resource allocation problems. More specifically, I'm looking at police dispatch strategies in responding to calls for service.

I'm under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Daniel Birks](https://essl.leeds.ac.uk/law/staff/261/dr-daniel-birks) and [Prof. Nick Malleson](http://nickmalleson.co.uk/).
