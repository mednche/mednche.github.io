### Project background

Coming soon

[comment]: <> (
- What is police demand. Introduce abreviation CFS


### Data 

The data used in these visualisations comes from the following sources:

- [Historical calls for service data for Detroit](https://data.detroitmi.gov/Public-Safety/DPD-911-Calls-for-Service-September-20-2016-Presen/wgv9-drfc)

- [Location of Detroit police stations](https://data.detroitmi.gov/Public-Safety/DPD-911-Calls-for-Service-September-20-2016-Presen/wgv9-drfc)

For analysis:
- [Boundaries of police precincts](https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/dpd-precincts/data?geometry=-83.758%2C42.264%2C-82.440%2C42.442)

### Maps

The dataset is huge. In order to make the visualisation smoother, we'll select a sample of it. 

Let's say we are interested in visualising CFS demand for the evening shift of January 20, 2019. The shift begins at 4pm and runs for 11 hours.
