### Project background

Coming soon

[comment]: <> (
- What is police demand. Introduce abreviation CFS


### Data 

In order to make the simulation more realistic, the following data was incorporated:
- [Historical calls for service data for Detroit](https://data.detroitmi.gov/Public-Safety/DPD-911-Calls-for-Service-September-20-2016-Presen/wgv9-drfc)
- [Location of Detroit police stations](https://data.detroitmi.gov/Public-Safety/DPD-911-Calls-for-Service-September-20-2016-Presen/wgv9-drfc)
- Open Street Map data (accessed using the [OSMNX python library](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)). This data contains information on:
  * Infrastructure of the road network (road type, length and number of lanes)
  * Location of traffic lights
  * Speed limit on street segment

For analysis:
- [Boundaries of police districts](https://data.detroitmi.gov/Government/City-Council-Districts/4vse-9zps)

### Maps

The dataset is huge. In order to make the visualisation smoother, we'll select a sample of it. 

Let's say we are interested in visualising CFS demand for the evening shift of January 20, 2019. The shift begins at 4pm and runs for 11 hours.
