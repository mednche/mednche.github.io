### GA overview


[comment]: <> (Population of individual strategies made of key parameters. List of parameters:)



In the single-objective optimisation, the only objective is to minimise **response time**, as a proxy for **effectivness**.

In the multi-objective optimisation, on the other hand, two competeting objectives are chosen:
- Effectiveness: Minimise response time
- Efficiency: Minimise number of vehicles deployed


At each generation, the algorithm: 

1. Breeds the population: Creates lambda offspring from mu parents in the population: 
- crossover (pair of parents) with additional possible mutation, or
- cloning (one parent) with additional possible mutation.

If mutating the offspring, all features in the individual have the same independant probability of being mutated.

2. Selects survivors: Selects mu survivors amongst the lambda offspring using the chosen selection algorithm.
This applies a selective pressure and maintains the population size mu constant across generations.
Each individual strategy is evaluated by running an ABM with its parameters (see [ABM of police dispatch](https://mednche.github.io/2019/09/23/ABM-police.html) project for details on ABM implementation.)


### Data 

In order to make the simulation more realistic, the following data was incorporated:
- [Historical calls for service data for Detroit](https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/911-calls-for-service?geometry=-86.058%2C42.028%2C-80.785%2C42.738)
- [Location of Detroit police stations](https://data.detroitmi.gov/Public-Safety/DPD-911-Calls-for-Service-September-20-2016-Presen/wgv9-drfc)
- Open Street Map data (accessed using the [OSMNX python library](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)). This data contains information on:
  * Infrastructure of the road network (road type, length and number of lanes)
  * Location of traffic lights
  * Speed limit on street segment

For analysis:
- [Boundaries of police districts](https://data.detroitmi.gov/Government/City-Council-Districts/4vse-9zps)

We notice that the GA learns after only a few generations that response time can be reduced by increasing the total number of vehicles deployed (as well as deploying them to the adequate stations.) 

Let's see which stations are being allocated more vehicles troughout the learning process.

The barcharts show, for each generation, the spatial allocation (of vehicles to stations) for the overall best individual known to the GA. This individual is recorded in the 'hall of fame', which is updated at every generation. If a better individual is found, it will replace the current best individual in the 'hall of fame'. There is only space for one 'champion' individual in the 'hall of fame'. 

Fewer changes to the allocation of vehicles are made later in the learning process, as no better champion strategy is found.


Now let's have a look at the spatial allocation of these vehicles to the police stations in Detroit. Click on the image below to open the interactive kepler map.

[comment]: <> (maybe genealogy tree)



We've observed that the GA learns that the best strategies are those that deploy **more vehicles**. 
Of course in practice, this is not doable, as the police face budget restrictions. Instead, it makes more sense to inlcude another objective in the optimisation: minimise cost, i.e. minimise total number of vehicles. 

#### 2. Multi objective optimisation of police resource allocation startegy.

Because the two objectives are competing, there is no single optimal solution. 
Instead, there are multiple Pareto optimal solutions along the Pareto frontier.
