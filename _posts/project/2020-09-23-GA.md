### Project Background and overview

Why we are optimising police resource allocation strategies.

Why we chose GAs.


### GA overview


Population of individual strategies made of key parameters. 
List of parameters:
-
-
-


In the single-objective optimisation, the only objective is to minimise **response time**, as a proxy for **effectivness**.


In the multi-objective optimisation, on the other hand, two competeting objectives are chosen:
- Effectivness: Minimise response time
- Efficiency: Minimise number of vehicles deployed


At each generation: 

1. Breed population: Create lambda offsrpings from mu parents in the population: 
- crossover (pair of parents) with additional possible mutation, or
- cloning (one parent) with additional possible mutation.

If mutating the offspring, each feature in the individual has the same independant probability of being mutated.

2. Survivor selection: Select mu survivors amongst the lambda offsprings using the chosen selection algorithm.
This applies selective pressure and maintain population size mu constant across generations.
Each individual strategy is evaluated by running an ABM with its parameters (see [ABM of police dispatch](https://mednche.github.io/2019/09/23/ABM-police.html) project for details on ABM implementation.)


### Data 

In order to make the simulation more realistic, the following data was incorporated:
- [Historical calls for service data for Detroit](https://data.detroitmi.gov/Public-Safety/DPD-911-Calls-for-Service-September-20-2016-Presen/wgv9-drfc)
- [Location of Detroit police stations](https://data.detroitmi.gov/Public-Safety/DPD-911-Calls-for-Service-September-20-2016-Presen/wgv9-drfc)
- Open Street Map data (accessed using the [OSMNX python library](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)). This data contains information on:
  * Infrastructure of the road network (road type, length and number of lanes)
  * Location of traffic lights
  * Speed limit on street segment

For analysis:
- [Boundaries of police districts](https://data.detroitmi.gov/Government/City-Council-Districts/4vse-9zps)

### Results


#### 1. Single objective optimisation of police resource allocation startegy.

Visualisation:
- graph fitness reduction 
- GIF learning num vehicles

- map best strategy num of vehicles

- maybe genealogy tree


We notice that the GA learns after a few iterations that the best strategies are those that deploy **more vehicles**. 
Of course in practice, this is not doable, as the police face budget restrictions. Instead, it makes more sense to inlcude another objective in the optimisation: minimising cost. 


#### 2. Multi objective optimisation of police resource allocation startegy.

Because the two objectives are competing, there is no single optimal solution. 
Instead, there are multiple Pareto optimal solutions along the Pareto frontier.
